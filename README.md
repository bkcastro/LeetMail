Personal project to help me better my skills 

This project was created to help me with my personal programming goals, I wanted to stay complete a leetcode question everyday but would often forget or get lazy. So I decided to automate this process by creating a webapp that allows you to personalize the type of questions you want to answer. Then every morning my backend will send the users that have signed up a random question that aligns with their request.
