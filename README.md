Personal project to help me better my skills 

This project was created to help me with my personal programming goals, I wanted to complete a leetcode question every day but would often forget or get lazy. So I decided to automate this process by creating a webapp that allows you to personalize the type of questions you want to answer. Then every morning my backend will send the users that have signed up a random question that aligns with their request. 

The main features of leetMail: 
Choose which days you want to receive a question 
Choose what difficulties 
Choose what topics you want to tackle

How you will get the question: 
My app will send you the questions you chose on the days you chose via email at 6 am PT.
